### Hacktoberfest 2022 for Treehouse TechDegree Students
# Secret Project - Mike the Frog Chatbot

This is the Super Secret project for Hacktoberfest 2022, created for Treehouse TechDegree students. This is our attempt on creating something akin to Rubber Duck Debugg's [Talk to a Duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/cyberduck/) chatbot... only with less sass.
